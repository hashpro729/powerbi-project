A crypto trend analysis project dashboard created on Power BI is a powerful tool designed to provide a comprehensive overview and in-depth insights into the world of cryptocurrency markets. This dashboard combines data visualization, analytics, and reporting to assist users in understanding and tracking trends, making informed decisions, and optimizing their cryptocurrency investments. Here's a description of key features and components commonly found in such a dashboard

**Overview Metrics:** The dashboard typically starts with high-level metrics such as the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies, the current price of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, trading volume, and overall market sentiment. These metrics give users an immediate sense of the current state of the market.

**Price Charts:** Interactive price charts for various cryptocurrencies are central to the dashboard. Users can select different time frames (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) and specific cryptocurrencies to analyze historical price movements. Candlestick charts are often used to visualize open, close, high, and low prices over time.

**Market Trends:** Line charts or area charts can display trends in cryptocurrency prices over time. Users can overlay indicators like moving averages or Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify potential buy/sell signals.
